      <h1>About Task or Treat</h1>
      <p>The idea came about from listening to several podcasts about the benefits of giving, combined with the idea of service hours for school, and a drive to engage more with the people in my local community.</p>
      <p>Around the time of Giving Tuesday, my podcast feed exploded with episodes about the importance of giving and the benefits of doing good. 
        I'm fairly busy with everyday life so, while this was inspiring, I was looking for an easy way to give to others what was straight-forward, but also provided an opportinity to interact directly with them.</p>
      <p>My children's school also has a requirement for service hours they need to meet each year so I was trying to figure out a way I could incorporate that into my giving activities.
        Last year my wife had the inspired idea of going door to door and collecting things that could be recycled but weren't handled by normal curbside recycling as part of a service project.
        It was a great idea and I appreciated the fact that it also served as a way to engage with the community. This was also the inspiration for incorporating the "Trick or Treat" aspect of Task or Treat.</p>
      <p>Many people are facing a crisis of loneliness and disconnection in our communities. Doing kind acts for each other is one possible way to combat that and could encourage interaction and connection.</p>  
      <p>Task or Treat combines the spirit of Halloween with the joy of giving. Please join us in spreading kindness and community spirit!</p>

      <h2>When to go Task or Treating</h2>
      <p>In short, whenever you want, and as often as you want! I'm reluctant to suggest any dates for this since any time is a good time and there's no reason to impose any restrictions on it.
        Personally I think a good time would be in the spring, when we're well past the holiday season and a more common time for giving. Another suggestion is today, because the best time to do something is when you're inspired to do it.</p>
